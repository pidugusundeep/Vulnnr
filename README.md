## Reason
<small><b>
Well really there was one reason into making this<br>
I wanted it to be a a vulnerability scanner with the latest a greatest<br>
exploits, mass endpoint scanners & exploiters, why? U may ask is because scanners/exploiters like this are costly because skids like to make a extra buck<br>
I wanted this to be a free tool like xattacker 3.0 anyone could use to pentest there site, this project i will never give up on and i will continue working on it,<br>
everyday il try to push a update or update the src and then il push it to github at the end of the week, requiring u to update.
thanks for using vullnr have a nice day!
